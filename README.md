Converts pdf file to txt file , run in cmd and user can input the path of input and output file.
The codes was originally from the project of "wwiras/mypdf2text". Thank you very much for wwiras's great codes.

I modified his code to be able to run in CMD with user input prompt, and could convert code in "UTF-8" rather than
wwiras's "cp1252", using UTF-8 encoding, supports a wider range of characters, especially when handling Chinese.
